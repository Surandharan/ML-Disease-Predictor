This study focuses on the development of a predictive model for diabetes and heart 
disease using a fused machine learning approach. Diabetes and heart disease are two major 
health concerns worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient 
outcomes. By integrating various machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques, 
we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of prediction models.

The primary objective of this research paper is to address the performance 
limitations of individual machine learning models by developing a fused machine 
learning model. The aim is to enhance the prediction accuracy for diabetes using a 
combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
algorithms. By integrating the strengths of these two models, we aim to overcome the 
shortcomings of individual approaches and improve the overall predictive performance. 
The proposed fusion model will leverage the distinctive characteristics of SVM and 
ANN, resulting in a more robust and accurate prediction framework for diabetes.
