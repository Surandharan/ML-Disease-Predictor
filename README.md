<h1>Prediction of Diabetes and Heart Disease using Fused Machine Learning</h1>

<p>This study focuses on the development of a predictive model for diabetes and heart disease using a fused machine learning approach. Diabetes and heart disease are two major health concerns worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. By integrating various machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of prediction models.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The primary objective of this research paper is to address the performance limitations of individual machine learning models by developing a fused machine learning model. The aim is to enhance the prediction accuracy for diabetes using a combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms. By integrating the strengths of these two models, we aim to overcome the shortcomings of individual approaches and improve the overall predictive performance. The proposed fusion model will leverage the distinctive characteristics of SVM and ANN, resulting in a more robust and accurate prediction framework for diabetes.</p>

<p>This research paper aims to contribute to the field of healthcare by providing an advanced predictive model for diabetes and heart disease. The fused machine learning approach has the potential to improve early detection and enable timely intervention, leading to better patient outcomes.</p>
